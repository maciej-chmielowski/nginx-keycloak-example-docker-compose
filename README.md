# nginx-keycloak-example-docker-compose
I have spent a lot of time trying to make keycloak work with nginx. I hope to help others with this example config. 

For local development with https I have used mkcert. This is probably not a working example though the nginx/keycloak config part should work. - I pulled it out of my hobby project.
